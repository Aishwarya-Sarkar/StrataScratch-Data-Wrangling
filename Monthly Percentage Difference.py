#Question: Given a table of purchases by date, calculate the month-over-month percentage change in revenue. The output should include the year-month date (YYYY-MM) and 
#percentage change, rounded to the 2nd decimal point, and sorted from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. The percentage change column will be populated 
#from the 2nd month forward and can be calculated as ((this month's revenue - last month's revenue) / last month's revenue)*100.
